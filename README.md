Welcome to my portfolio website! This site showcases my projects and skills in SQL, Python, Tableau, PowerBI and Excel. Below, you'll find a brief overview of what you can expect to find on this site.

## Projects

### 1. COVID Portfolio Project
Description: In the COVID Portfolio Project, we dive into the vast pool of global COVID-19 data using SQL Server. This endeavor aims to thoroughly analyze datasets concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, with a specific focus on unraveling trends, patterns, and impacts across different geographical areas and timeframes.

### 2. Cleaning Data in SQL
Description: In the "Cleaning Data in SQL" project, we're taking messy housing data and sprucing it up in SQL Server. The idea is to get it ready for analysis by making it cleaner and more organized. We're fixing mistakes, filling in any missing info, and basically making it easier to understand and work with.

## About Me

Hey there! I'm Akilan Pandiyan. For a while now, I've been working with data as an ETL developer. Recently, I decided to take a break and focus on growing personally, so I'm studying for a Master's in Computer Science. I already have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, so I'm excited to learn even more and try new things.

I really enjoy working with data and turning it into useful information. I know how to use tools like SQL and Python to do that. When I'm not working with computers, I like spending time outside or trying out new tech stuff.
